    <h2 id="o">Game Overview</h2>
    Chess is a two-player strategy board game that is played on an 8x8 grid. The game involves 16 pieces for each player, including a king, queen, rooks, knights, bishops, and pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means it is in a position to be captured and cannot escape.
